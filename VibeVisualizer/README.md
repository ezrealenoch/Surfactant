# SBOM Visualizer

A web-based application for parsing and visualizing Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) JSON files produced by Surfactant.

## Overview

The SBOM Visualizer is designed to help developers, security analysts, and system administrators quickly inspect SBOM elements and readily determine common dependencies with clear, color-coded highlights. It provides both graph and matrix visualizations of SBOMs and their relationships.

## Features

- **Import multiple SBOM files**: Upload one or more SBOM JSON files via drag-and-drop or file selection.
- **Interactive visualizations**: View SBOMs as network graphs or dependency matrices.
- **Common dependency highlighting**: Automatically identify and highlight components shared across multiple SBOMs.
- **Component details**: View detailed metadata for each component including cryptographic hashes and ELF information.
- **Search functionality**: Find components by name, vendor, or other attributes.
- **Filtering options**: Show/hide different component types or specific SBOMs.
- **Export capabilities**: Export visualizations as PNG/SVG or data as JSON/CSV.
- **Report generation**: Create detailed HTML reports summarizing SBOM contents and common dependencies.

## Integration with Surfactant

This visualizer is designed to work with SBOM files generated by the Surfactant tool. It can be used to:
1. Visualize complex dependency relationships in SBOMs
2. Compare multiple SBOMs to identify common dependencies
3. Explore detailed component metadata extracted by Surfactant

## File Format Support

The application supports SBOM JSON files structured similarly to:
- helics_sbom.json
- helics_libs_sbom.json
- helics_binaries_sbom.json

Any SBOM files generated by Surfactant should be compatible with this visualizer.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
2. Import SBOM files by clicking the "Import SBOM" button or dragging files into the browser window
3. Use the sidebar options to toggle between visualizations and adjust filters
4. Click on components to view detailed information

## Technical Details

The SBOM Visualizer is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any build tools or server-side components. It leverages the following libraries:

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data visualization
- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) for file export functionality

## Browser Compatibility

The application works best in modern browsers that support ES6+ JavaScript features and the latest web standards. For optimal performance, use the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.
